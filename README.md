# movie_reviews_web_scraping

## In this project I have done a fully web scraping for a movie reviews website (rogerebert.com) hosted by different people.
 each review show a poster of the movie , the movie title , the name of reviewer and movie rate/5. 

The poster and the title both is a hyperlink for a more detailed review
