# movie_reviews_web_scraping

 In this project I have done a fully web scraping for a movie reviews website (rogerebert.com) hosted by different people.
 each review show a poster of the movie , the movie title , the name of reviewer and movie rate/5. 

The poster and the title both is a hyperlink for a more detailed review 

By using python and beauitfulSoup library, I have done a complete scraping for these data for 27 different movies.
Gather and sort the data into the dataset contain of 4 column and 27 record 

Note : Scrap each full star as one point , half star not included 
So for the Brother movie the rate consider as 3 point in our dataset 



Columns:
[Name]: movie title 
[Reviewer name]: reviewer name 
[Rate/5]: the movie rate 
[Review link]: a link for the detailed review
